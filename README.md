## Problem Definition

Whether you are a small or large organisation or a collection of organisations capturing analytics and gathering insights across products, websites and business processes is key for measuring and improving quality of service to clients.

## Overview

The following document provides a scalable approach to rolling out organisational analytics capability.

## Principles
| Principle | Description | Rationale | Implications | 
|--|--|--|--|
| Principal/Agent conflict | Every party involved will have different incentives, funding models and levels of maturity.  It is important to state at a high level the overall objective |  | Allow different federations for organisations whom have vastly different requirements and incentives.
| Long lived product support model  | | | 
| Low barrier to onboarding and upskilling | | Minimize maintenance footprint  | 
| Provide a federated service | | | 
| 80/20 Rule | You will be able to achieve 80 percent of your requirements with a small percentage of effort.  The last 20 percent will take the majority of the effort. |  | Use software a service to start rather than bespoke on or premise development.

### Funding Model

One of the critical things to determine is how are you going to fund your analytics service.  Will you create a cost center and fund that cost center.  Will you partner with a provider to provide analytics capability will upskilling in-house.

I advise starting in-house first and complementing with a partner to provide specialist knowledge.

### Operational Support Model and Federation



### Onboarding 

To be onboarded to an analytics service 

### Federation

Federation is the concept of organisations being able to sign up to use a service, but also share their data across other organisations.  Organisations can join or leave easily at any time.  Privacy considerations when federating are paramount i.e a company should take into account privacy by design and what information can be infered when enriching datasets. 

### Privacy

- IP Address Masking
- Anonmymization of data
- GDPR
- Privacy by Design
